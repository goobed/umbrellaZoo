## Pipeline Overview

The Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline is a project type that automatically detects branches in the repository and creates a pipeline for each branch. This allows for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) on multiple branches with minimal setup.

### Key Features:
- Automated pipeline creation for new branches.
- Separate build and test jobs for each branch.
- Supports feature, development, and production branches.
- Integration with source control to trigger builds on code changes.
